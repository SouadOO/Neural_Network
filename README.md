### Neural Network

For this part we have three main tasks:

 - Task 1: Download a benchmark data set
 - Task 2: Train a classification neural net	
 - Task 3: Train an autoencoder neural net

To do it we have two folders and one file:
        
 - data: in this folder you can find the used data semeion.data.
 - NN.ipynb:  Notebook of jupyter where you can find the code for the tasks with describtion of the work done, observision,results obtained.
 - img : here you can find all used  img for report in jupyter.
